                <h2 class="section-title">Reasons for the Selection of the Digital Business</h2>
                <p>To understand the reasoning for the selected business, background context is needed. Waterstones
                    began forty-two years ago, and to this day owns three hundred bookstores (Waterstones, 2019). What
                    helps to set Waterstones apart from its direct and indirect competitors is its insistence on
                    promoting and championing books that are not as popular as larger audience books but are still good
                    (Waterstones, 2019). Doing this gives good insight into Waterstone's understanding of quality over
                    quantity, curating content that could particularly connect with a specific audience of users, and
                    finally giving attention to specific areas of users that may get overlooked by direct and indirect
                    competitors.</p>
                <p>It is important to consider and acknowledge Waterstone's impact on the digital retail sector. The
                    varied platforms, both offline and online, provide a thought-out range of books and products for
                    customers to browse through, ensuring that in a world where being digital expands the options
                    available ten-fold, users of Waterstone get to experience a personalized selection of books that are
                    potentially more suited for them.</p>
                <p>There are a few reasons why Waterstone was chosen as the specific case study of this report:</p>

                    of Amazon and eBooks in the UK (Winterhoff, 2021). The company itself responded by allowing the use
                    of Kindle readers to be sold in-store, drawing in customers who preferred a more digital reading
                    experience. This worked well short term, but the realization was that in the long term, it would
                    cause significant damage as customers would flock more so to online and digital books, rather than
                    in-store Waterstone bookshops (Winterhoff, 2021). Initiatives were put in place to combat this
                    threat and growing direct competitors. The company introduced public Wi-Fi into their bookshops in
                    the hope of improving the general experience, allowing users to keep themselves occupied whilst
                    browsing products in-store (Winterhoff, 2021). Additionally, and most significantly, the
                    introduction of click-and-collect services bolstered the number of channels consumers could go down
                    to obtain their bought product. Such an introduction kickstarted their digital presence, as it
                    allowed users to order online and collect in a store of their choosing (Winterhoff, 2021).</p>

                <h2 class="section-title">Market Positioning and Competitive Advantage</h2>
                <p>Secondly, a SWOT analysis carried out by Zigu (n.d.) highlighted one of Waterstone’s significant
                    strengths being “Strategic tie-ups with e-commerce companies”. By doing this, Waterstone
                    significantly bolstered its reach and influence across the UK, reaching a much broader customer base
                    and reaching potential customers who may have difficulty shopping physically in-store for products.
                    Additionally, by leveraging the services of e-commerce stores, they are automatically diversifying
                    the way customers can interact with them, and the channel options available to them. Having a more
                    digital presence allows Waterstone to better review and analyze customer behavior, specifically with
                    how they are shopping, and what types of products they are specifically shopping for.</p>

            <!-- Evaluation of potential information and data sources -->
            <section class="article-section">
                <h2 class="section-title">Evaluation of Potential Information and Data Sources</h2>
                <p>The way Waterstone is viewed as the last remaining physical branch in the UK means that a lot of
                    attention is given to it, with people still admiring the way Waterstone persists despite the
                    surrounding digital dominance and convenience of the book sector. Because of this, many data sources
                    are available to be looked at and evaluated; articles, blogs, and official documents submitted to
                    the UK government. Most of the online information comes from established news sources, such as The
                    Guardian, The Standard, and the Retail Gazette. As mentioned before, Waterstone also publishes
                    official information requested by the UK government.</p>
                <p>Waterstone was initially bought by a Russian oligarch in the year 2011, but 7 years later was
                    purchased as a majority stake by the Elliot Management Corporation (Kleinman, 2022). This purchase
                    had significance, as it helped to shift the focal landscape of the company and re-emphasize
                    Waterstone’s focused dedication to the UK market, as it had always held back when it was created in
                    1982.</p>
                <p>Additionally, public data shows off Waterstone’s dominant influence across the UK of acquired
                    acquisitions, such as Blackwells and Barnes & Noble (Bartholomew, 2022). Because of such significant
                    acquisitions, the effect it has had on their digital footprint has increased. By owning these two
                    companies, their online market presence will automatically increase and could welcome an influx of
                    customers who would typically browse and shop at these two respective companies. More importantly,
                    by acquiring such acquisitions, not only does it increase their dominance over the physical market,
                    but it also gives them a growing competitive advantage in the digital market, allowing them to
                    compete more effectively with potential direct competitors such as Amazon and Apple Books, by
                    improving their competitive prices, customer quality services, and potentially by embracing further
                    elements of the digital world without having to risk their core physical presence within the UK
                    negatively.</p>
                <p>Finally, the owners of Waterstone are very open about their business acquisitions, and due to this,
                    news reports often get a detailed view of the business moves they make. A news report by Kleinman
                    (2024) detailed how the owners of Waterstone hope to make a £700 million takeover for high street
                    giant Curry’s. It should be acknowledged that such a significant acquisition could significantly
                    bolster Waterstone’s digital presence. A collaborative digital eco-system could be integrated, that
                    combines Waterstone’s digital products with Curry’s digital products to create and provide a more
                    efficient service for customers to use.</p>

            <!-- Evaluation of the potential usefulness of four analytical approaches -->
            <section class="article-section">
                <h2 class="section-title">Evaluation of the Potential Usefulness of Four Analytical Approaches</h2>
                <h3 class="subsection-title">Digital Marketplace Map</h3>
                <p>A digital marketplace map is a key causal factor regarding a successful case study. It can be
                    understood as an analytical understanding of a company's digital marketplace landscape, and in
                    essence how effective it is in exploiting the benefits of a digital marketplace map. The
                    micro-environment of a business is the focal point of this analysis. It focuses on elements such as
                    user persona creation, understanding customers, identifying competitors, both direct and indirect,
                    and finally acknowledging the potential intermediaries that might influence customers to visit a
                    company website or turn them off from it (Chaffey, 2014). It should be acknowledged that this method
                    does have a balance of pros and cons. A pro relates to insights that are typically data-driven; for
                    example, heatmaps. By being able to detect how consumers are shopping and the general pattern the
                    majority are taking, a company can better optimize for that specific pathway (Hueston, 2020).</p>
                <p>Waterstones as a book chain in the UK has become one of the dominant choices for bookselling,
                    especially brand-new products. However, a large part of their presence comes from being physically
                    dominant, and rather not digitally dominant. In terms of the digital marketplace map, it is
                    understood that Waterstone’s signature OVP would be their official website, official app, and any
                    bookstores they own in the UK. A drawback of this, and as emphasized by Chaffey (2014), the digital
                    marketplace map solely focuses on the user journey through the use of websites, and search engines.
                    Because of this, a large portion of Waterstone’s is cut-out, IE App, physical presence. Furthermore,
                    it can be assumed that this will not be an optimal approach as the digital marketplace map will
                    solely cover what can be considered a minor part of Waterstone’s overall presence and ignore other
                    elements that could prove vital to the overall analysis of the case study.</p>

                <h3 class="subsection-title">Consumer Channel Structures Analysis</h3>
                <p>The next analysis method to be covered also focuses on the micro-environment of a business. This
                    particular approach focuses on summarizing how product distribution channels have developed over the
                    years and specifically assesses the significance of these changes so that they can be turned into
                    channel theory (Shaw & Dawson, 1998). However, unlike the previous method, this particular method
                    allows for both digital, and physical journeys showing the difference, and sometimes allowing for
                    multi-method approaches. When Waterstones embraced the digital side and introduced online ordering
                    and click-and-collect services, it expanded the number of channels available to a consumer to use
                    depending on their preferences. Consumers could make use of a multi-method; ordering online and
                    going into their nearest store to pick up a new book, or they could purely go down the one route and
                    have it ordered and delivered straight to their door.</p>
                <p>Waterstone has several suppliers that help support book stock, and also ensure that online deliveries
                    are carried out in a consistent and high-standard manner. Waterstone ensures the trust of all online
                    deliveries to Royal Mail, ensuring that customers do not have to interact with Royal Mail and that
                    all order details are managed on Waterstone’s store or app (Delivery Options | Waterstones.com Help
                    | Waterstones, n.d.). The process of creating a consumer channel structure model for Waterstones
                    will help to analyze how the company is run, whilst showing how their consumer channels have grown
                    to benefit not only themselves but also the convenience of the customer.</p>

                <h3 class="subsection-title">Value Analysis</h3>
                <p>The point of value analysis is to pinpoint where the strongest elements of value are being created
                    within a company, all with the result of ensuring customers have a satisfactory experience.</p>
                <blockquote>
                    Value analysis (VA) is a tool to enhance cost efficiency by evaluating the functionality of a
                    product or a process about its cost. It helps identify and eliminate unnecessary costs incurred
                    while making a product or conducting a business function.
                    <footer>Venkatesh, 2021</footer>
                </blockquote>
                <p>Value analysis could be beneficial to attempt an evaluation of their digital platforms; website and
                    app. By doing this, Waterstone could continue to assess areas where unnecessary costs are being
                    directed towards, and instead direct it towards areas that could potentially improve the overall
                    customer experience. Of the three value analysis methods; value chain, value network, and value
                    shop, it can be argued that the value chain is the most effective and relevant when talking about
                    Waterstones. This is because the value chain focuses on online sales, and customer engagement, two
                    things Waterstones engages in. It is important to acknowledge however that the value shop and value
                    network could additionally be used to analyze Waterstone's eco-system and to better understand its
                    digital channels.</p>

                <h3 class="subsection-title">SLEPT Analysis</h3>
                <p>SLEPT analysis, standing for Social, Legal, Economic, Political, and Technological analysis, is
                    similar to other analytical methods that study the macro environment of a business. However, it
                    studies the risks of specific sections to see whether they have affected the business positively or
                    negatively. Potential main factors this analytical factor would specifically focus on include;
                    social, legal, and technological. As mentioned before, part of Waterstone’s successful physical
                    dominance across the UK came from focusing on each store's local area. Arguably this could be the
                    same case digitally. In terms of legal factors, this could be seen in the way they handle
                    accessibility on their digital platforms, cookies handling, and even secure payments. Additionally,
                    they have a rigorous process for users who want to upload a book to be sold on the digital platform.
                </p>
                <p>Over time since Waterstone's digital introduction, it has struggled to compete against large digital,
                    already established platforms like Amazon, which is considered a direct competitor. However, their
                    transition to the digital platform is not without its perks. Figure 1 shows that Waterstones has
                    found a way to use its digitalization to keep a sense of focus on the local community, providing
                    easy-to-find information about events tied to specific areas in the UK.</p>
                <p>The reference of Figure 2 shows how potential independent book publishers have to proceed with
                    getting their books published on the Waterstones digital platform. By inputting basic information
                    about a product, they will more than likely have to adhere to copyright and intellectual property
                    laws, in summary complying with Waterstone's publishing compliance regulations, and regulations of
                    the UK as a whole.</p>

            <!-- Conclusion -->
            <section class="article-section">
                <h2 class="section-title">Conclusion</h2>
                <p>In conclusion, this initial report shows that whilst Waterstones continues to embrace its digital
                    capabilities, they still have a very strong physical presence, and therefore embrace both. Their
                    methods of response to direct competitors such as Amazon such as click-and-collect services and
                    partnerships and acquisitions that strengthen their presence demonstrate their ability to adapt in
                    an ever-growing digital market.</p>
                <p>The four analytical methods help to shed light on Waterstones' own strengths, and areas for
                    improvement, especially considering the structure of their consumer channels and the points raised
                    by SLEPT analysis. Overall, this brief analysis has helped to shed light on some of the complexities
                    that arise when attempting to integrate digital technology into innately physical retail presences.
                    But by leveraging said digital technology, this report has also helped to show how Waterstones has
                    and will potentially continue to evolve in an ever-growing digital market.</p>
